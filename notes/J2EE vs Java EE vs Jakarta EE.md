# J2EE vs Java EE vs Jakarta EE?

Are you confused about these terms? What are they?\
generally speaking, they're referring to the same thing (a set of enterprise specification) but used in different time in Java history.\

The first version of Java was released on January 23, 1996, and Java Enterprise extensions were part of the core JDK.\
Since Java 2 in December 1999, the extensions are taken out from the core libraries and been called J2EE (Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition).\

In May 2006, Java 5 was released and J2EE was renamed to Java EE (Java Platform Enterprise Edition).

In September 2017, a big change happened. Oracle decided to give away the rights of Java EE to Eclipse Foundation. 
But Oracle still owns "Java" brand, which means Eclipse Foundation cannot use "Java" this word.
In order to solve the copyright issue, Eclipse Foundation either buys the brand or use another name.
Obviously, from the result, we can see Eclipse Foundation renamed Java EE to Jakarta EE which is picked by the community.

In a nutshell, J2EE, Java EE and Jakarta EE are referred to the same thing.
