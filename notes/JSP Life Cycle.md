# JSP Life Cycle
A JSP life cycle is defined as the process from its creation till the destruction. 
This is similar to a servlet life cycle with an additional step which is required to compile a JSP into servlet.

The following are the paths followed by a JSP:
* Translation
* Compilation
* Initialization
* Execution
* Cleanup

Here is a diagram of JSP Lifecycle
